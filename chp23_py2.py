# some rando's utility functions @ https://gist.github.com/shazow/603374

# xrange() -- Think this is a shortened version of range that defaults to begin @ 0?
# KeyError() some sort of error that is raised -- specific kind?
#defaultdict() -- Think this allocates an empty dictionary?
# yield -- Think this brings a value out of a loop somehow in a clever way?
# * and ** in args to function -- Some sorta dark magic here.
# zip() no clue on this guy
